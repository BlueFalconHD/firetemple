# ðŸ¦Š Finding your Firefox profile location
To find your profile location, open your prefered Firefox version or a fork/modification of Firefox and (in the address bar) open `about:support`. This is the page with diagnostic information about the open instance of Firefox. Then scroll down to `Profile Folder` and copy the path to your clipboard or save it to somewhere for later.
